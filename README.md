# ESG Susinvest - Company Analysis for ESG Investing
A web project that takes in a company name as input and scores the company based on the sentiment of news articles involving the company with regard to environment, social and governance (ESG) factors. It aims to be a tool for ESG investors to get a quick estimate of the general ESG value of a company before delving deeper via commercial tools offered by brokers (or otherwise).

Written in Python using the Django framework. Uses the Scrapy library and GDELT database. This project was created for the 2022 Hack Cambridge Atlas Hackathon in Cambridge, UK.
